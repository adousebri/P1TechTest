Required Applications: Mockoon https://mockoon.com/

Load "Secci API.json" and start Mockoon

React page isn't work becuase:

localhost/:1  Access to fetch at 'https://localhost:7169/api/Summary' from origin 'https://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
App.jsx:44 

The API has been tested using swagger and is working as expected.
