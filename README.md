# P1TechTest

Required Applications: Mockoon https://mockoon.com/

Current State:

P1Test.API.SECCI
P1Test.API.SECCI.IntegrationTest

All components should be in place however, the integration tests are failing (RestSharp isn't constructing the URL as expected)

P1Test.API.SECCI.Test

These tests were generated by ChatGPT; the tests in SecciApiTests failed because at some point RestSharp moved ExecuteAsync to an extension method and it can't be mocked.

P1Test.Interfaces
P1Test.Models

Projects supporting decoupling 

P1Test.MiddleWare

Work started but issues with P1Test.Web and MediatR caused delays; at this point, I would normally reach out to the Team to ask for help. I think I have missed something obvious.
